## What
It's a reservoir simulation software based on Excel, which is developed with Python language. That's, Microsoft Excel is the main work platform or main frame for reservoir simulation work, but the software is not developed with the embedded VBA, but Python. 
## Why
Reservoir or geological engineers are born data scientistsÔºÅAnd Python is the popular language for data analysis, machine learning and AI, refer to [How popular is Python](https://www.quora.com/How-popular-is-python "Python is popular"). And, Microsoft Excel is the software we use frequently when we work. Why not write a reservoir simulation processing software based on Excel+Python, which will enable us to learn new python skill while working in a familiar Excel environment.
